  "body": "### Overview\r\nSoftware-Defined Networking(SDN) is a new architecture that decouples \r\nthe network control and forwarding functions.\r\nIn SDN, distributed switches are managed by a logically-centralized \r\ncontroller. This architecture allows programmers to control the \r\nbehavior of the network by writing control programs.\r\n\r\nOpenflow is the first SDN standard. However, it faces two challenges:\r\n- Openflow is protocol dependent, which makes it difficult to support user-customized protocols.\r\n- Programming directly with Openflow is difficult. Many low-level details, such as managing flow tables on distributed switches, makes network policies hard to write and read.\r\n\r\nWe propose POP to solve these problems.\r\n\r\n![](pop.png)\r\n\r\nFollowing the idea of Maple, programmers implements\r\nthe application based on a centralized view. Instead of proposing\r\na new programming language, the network policy can\r\nbe implemented in general-purpose programming languages by calling\r\nAPI's of a runtime system, as long as there are API stubs implemented\r\nfor the language. The runtime system learns the policy by monitoring the execution of the user\r\nprogram and then generating flow tables automatically, which will be installed on switches.\r\n\r\nTo make POP independent of predefined\r\nprotocols, we use POF (Protocol Oblivious Forwarding) as the\r\ninterface between the controller and switches.\r\nIn this standard, all protocol-specific contents are replaced by `(offset, length)` tuples. This enables\r\nus to support any user customized protocols.\r\n\r\nAt the high level, the user provides specifications of the syntax\r\nof headers, from which a parser of packets can be derived to \r\ntranslate field names of headers to the `(offset, length)` tuples.\r\n\r\n### People\r\nAuthors:\r\n- Chunhui He  (Advisor: Xinyu Feng)\r\n\r\nContributors:\r\n- Dongyang Wang\r\n- Tiwei Bie\r\n- Hu Ge\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nPlease send inquiries/comments/reports to: hchunhui@mail.ustc.edu.cn\r\n\r\n----\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hchunhui/pop.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hchunhui/pop)",
