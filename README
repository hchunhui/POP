POP accepts two parameters as input: application and header specification.

    main/controller -f apps/app.so -h header.spec

Applications are located in the "apps" directory, they are compiled into .so files.

Header specification defines fields of packet headers. "scripts/header.spec" is a
sample header specification.

There are two sample applications:

l3_multi: IPV4 unicast & multicast, SDNP unicast.

    main/controller -f apps/l3_multi.so -h scripts/header.spec

l2_learning: MAC learning switch.

    main/controller -f apps/l2_learning.so -h scripts/header.spec
